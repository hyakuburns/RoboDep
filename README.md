# RoboDep
Possible simple dependency(?) manager for Robopill

## Usage
```rbd up``` to read the ```dep.robo``` file, it doesn't exist it'll be created.

```rbd git``` to fetch a git repository, if the file doesn't exist it'll be created.

```rbd hg``` to fetch a mercurial repository, if the file doesn't exist it'll be created.
