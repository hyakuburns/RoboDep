* RoboDep
Possible simple dependency(?) manager for Robopill.

** Usage
~rbd up~ to read the ~dep.robo~ file, it doesn't exist it'll be created.

~rbd git [URL]~ to fetch a git repository, if the file doesn't exist it'll be created.

~rbd hg [URL]~ to fetch a mercurial repository, if the file doesn't exist it'll be created.

*** syntax highlighting

*** Clarification
This is based around the idea of cloning projects and compiling or tweaking
for your needs. This is not a complete robust package manager, nor should it
be one, but if you come up with a decent idea to add to it, do tell.
